# Demo Server-Driven UI

This is a demo project to show how React (or actually TSX) can be used to create native interfaces for Android, iOS, and the web, where all presentation logic is driven from the server. This project is used as a demo for the talk **Server-Driven UI using React-ish** that [Jessica Sk√•rbratt](https://github.com/jessiskarbratt) and I give at different conferences. It is also used and explained in the article [Introduction to Server-Driven UI](https://joakimkemeny.com/writing/2023-10-18-server-driven-ui-intro). To understand this project, you should read the article.
